# Patch2PDF

Patch2PDF takes the hassle out of generating patch plans and plots for event lighting.

Simply upload a **MVR** file — Patch2PDF handles the rest.

Beyond patch generation, Patch2PDF aims to be a **centralised platform** for simplifying event lighting planning.

Planned features include:
- Adding and managing notes
- Uploading documents (e.g. venue reference photos)
- Maintaining a projects calendar
- Automatically generating packing lists from uploaded MVR files
- And more...

---

## 🚀 Goals
- Streamline the workflow for lighting designers and technicians
- Reduce repetitive setup tasks
- Provide a single hub for event lighting documentation
